# Agent Sandbox Permissions

Constrain ESPAgent behavior with tool-level sandboxing, least privilege,
confirmation gates, bounded execution, and auditable hardware actions.

## When to use

Use this when a request involves tool execution, hardware control, automation,
MQTT Mesh commands, file writes, OTA, external API calls, or any action where an
LLM could overstep its intended authority.

## Core rule

The LLM may propose actions, but execution must be constrained by deterministic
firmware controls. Do not trust natural language as authorization.

Required execution chain:

```text
LLM intent
  -> tool schema
  -> tool_registry whitelist
  -> role capability check
  -> Guardian policy_check
  -> command queue or dry-run
  -> local safety interlock
  -> driver
  -> OutputMessage + audit
```

## Risk levels

- `read_only`: weather, time, low-sensitivity sensor read, node status.
- `low_control`: WS2812/status light, short harmless UI feedback.
- `medium_control`: servo, GPIO output, relay pulse, buzzer, fan short run.
- `high_control`: pump, humidifier, heater, door lock, long relay/fan action.
- `privacy`: presence, camera, microphone, user profile, routine inference.
- `system`: OTA, credentials, Wi-Fi config, memory/session deletion, file writes.

## Policy

1. Use the narrowest tool that satisfies the request.
2. Prefer role-targeted Mesh commands over hard-coded node IDs.
3. For medium/high/system/privacy actions, require Guardian policy first.
4. For high-risk or persistent actions, require explicit user confirmation.
5. Every continuous action must have a bounded `duration_s` or `ttl_ms`.
6. Every automation rule must have `interval_s`, `cooldown_s`, and a clear stop
   or remove path.
7. Never let MQTT callbacks directly drive hardware. They must enter validation,
   policy, queue, interlock, and audit.
8. Deny unknown actions, unknown GPIO pins, unbounded duration, missing target,
   malformed JSON, or actions outside the node's role.

## Dry-run behavior

Use dry-run when the action is novel, risky, persistent, or ambiguous. Explain
the planned tool, target role, risk level, constraints, and confirmation needed.

Example:

```json
{
  "mode": "dry_run",
  "target_role": "control_agent",
  "action": "humidifier_on",
  "risk_level": "high_control",
  "constraints": {
    "duration_s": 600,
    "cooldown_s": 1200
  },
  "requires_confirm": true
}
```

## Hardware bounds

- GPIO: only use allowed pins from firmware policy.
- Servo: clamp angle and speed; never oscillate without a stop condition.
- Relay/fan/pump/humidifier: require duration and cooldown.
- Automation: reject rapid loops, mutually-triggering rules, and rules without
  hysteresis for noisy sensors.
- OTA: never trigger from normal chat without signed image, role match,
  Guardian approval, and explicit user confirmation.

## Research basis

This skill follows OWASP LLM risk categories for prompt injection, sensitive
information disclosure, excessive agency, and unbounded consumption; NIST AI RMF
risk governance principles; and MCP security lessons around scoped
authorization, least privilege, tool permissions, and auditability.
