# ESPAgent

ESPAgent is an ESP32-S3 Agent Mesh firmware project built on ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS. It runs a lightweight LLM Agent runtime on MCU hardware, connects Feishu/Lark chat, local WebSocket access, Serial CLI, SPIFFS memory, ReAct-style tool calling, MQTT Mesh communication, and real hardware tools into one embedded multi-node control system.

The project is maintained as ESPAgent. Public documentation, runtime logs, generated binaries, and directory structure should use the ESPAgent name consistently.

The current implementation targets a four-ESP32-S3 Agent Mesh:

- `coordinator_agent`: Feishu/WebSocket entry, LLM ReAct loop, task dispatch, timeline, and user replies.
- `sensor_agent`: AHT10/AHT20, SGP30, BH1750/GY-30, presence, and environment telemetry.
- `control_agent`: WS2812, GPIO, servo, relay/actuator boundary, and whitelisted hardware execution.
- `guardian_agent`: `policy_check`, `policy_decision`, audit, privacy boundary, watchdog, and lightweight StateBoard.

ESP32-P4+C6 and Android are Display Terminals. They subscribe to Mesh state, telemetry, timeline, alerts, and structured results to visualize reasoning, communication, sensor data, and final user-facing outcomes. They are not the fourth ESP32-S3 role.

This is still an MCU-oriented runtime, not a Linux multi-process agent framework. The Coordinator currently owns the main serial `agent_loop`; cross-node collaboration is implemented through MQTT Mesh commands, Guardian policy gates, structured `OutputMessage`, timeline events, and background automation tasks.

## Capabilities

- ESP32-S3 firmware built with ESP-IDF 6.1
- Feishu/Lark WebSocket channel for chat input and replies
- Local WebSocket gateway on port `18789`
- Serial CLI for diagnostics and local maintenance
- ReAct-style agent loop with LLM tool use
- Bounded `spawn_subagent` tool for focused search, weather/time, and SPIFFS file subtasks
- MQTT Mesh command routing with node/role targets
- Guardian-gated `policy_check` / `policy_decision` before remote Sensor/Control execution
- Structured `espagent.output.v1` OutputMessage for Mesh results, local tool results, and final replies
- Async `mesh_send_command` result reinjection: `async_task_id` first, later OutputMessage injected back into `message_bus`
- Timeline events for `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `mesh_command_queued`, `mesh_command_result`, `final_reply`, `error`, and Guardian audit
- Session trace JSONL for tool and async-result history
- Lightweight Guardian StateBoard exposed through Serial CLI
- Runtime skill benchmark over `/dev/ttyUSB0-3` for all SPIFFS skill readability, Mesh routing, sandbox, privacy, prompt-injection, workflow, and heap/cache snapshots
- SPIFFS-backed memory, sessions, skills, and config files
- Structured weather lookup through Amap WebService, with Nanjing Qixia District as the default location when configured
- Hardware tools for GPIO, WS2812, servo, MAX98357, AHT10/AHT20, SGP30, BH1750/GY-30, HC-SR05, and environment readings
- ESP-NOW environment telemetry sender
- MQTT state, telemetry, events, dispatch, timeline, alerts, and security topics
- Automation runtime for delayed workflows and persistent condition-action rules
- HTTPS OTA app update through the serial CLI
- Four ESP32-S3 role profiles: `coordinator_agent`, `sensor_agent`, `control_agent`, and `guardian_agent`
- Wi-Fi onboarding/admin AP under the `ESPAgent-XXXX` network name

Current verified highlights:

- Feishu entry can route common natural-language requests to Sensor or Control without requiring the user to name an MQTT node id.
- AHT20 on the Sensor role has been verified, with typical readings around `27.x C / 45-46%RH`.
- Sensor telemetry publishes AHT20 data on `espagent/cube1345/nodes/esp32s3-sensor-01/telemetry`.
- A humidity rule has been verified end to end: Coordinator automation reads Sensor AHT20 humidity, Guardian allows the action, and Control sets the WS2812 status light.
- ESP32-P4 display firmware has verified Wi-Fi/MQTT connect and topic subscription; full live UI binding should still be treated as in-progress.
- OTA is intentionally exposed through Serial CLI first, not as a Feishu/LLM tool.

## Runtime Flow

        |
        v

        +--> mesh_send_command
                 |
                 v
          Guardian policy_check / policy_decision
                 |
                 v
          Sensor or Control role command
                 |
                 v
          structured OutputMessage
                 |
                 v
          async result reinjection + timeline + Feishu/WebSocket reply
```

The ReAct loop is now a first-version cross-node loop: the Coordinator can reason, call a Mesh tool, wait asynchronously for the remote result, observe the structured OutputMessage, and then produce a user-facing answer.

## Automation Runtime

ESPAgent has a deterministic automation layer for requests that should not depend on a single open LLM turn.

- `automation_create_workflow`: creates one-shot ordered or delayed workflows, such as "turn red now, then blue after 10 seconds".
- `automation_create_rule`: creates persistent condition-action rules, such as "if humidity is above 40%, set the light red".
- `automation_list`: lists active workflows and rules.
- `automation_remove`: removes a workflow or rule.

Rules are stored in `/spiffs/automation.json`. A background `rule_task` scans conditions, while one-shot workflows run in temporary `workflow_task` instances. The current default limits are 8 rules, 8 workflow slots, and 8 steps per workflow.

Detailed placement rules are maintained in
[`docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md). In short: firmware code
belongs under `main/`, runtime SPIFFS seed files under `spiffs_data/`, host test
and flashing tools under `tools/`, and generated build/test output under ignored
`build*/` or `artifacts/` directories.

## Build

Load the ESP-IDF environment, then build:

```bash
idf.py build
```

The default firmware artifact is:

```text
build/ESPAgent.bin
```

Flash with:

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

For the current four-S3 setup, the recommended order is:

```text
/dev/ttyUSB0  coordinator_agent
/dev/ttyUSB1  sensor_agent
/dev/ttyUSB2  control_agent
/dev/ttyUSB3  guardian_agent
```

Use `/dev/ttyUSB0-3` for ESP32-S3 flashing. Do not flash ESP32-S3 role firmware to `/dev/ttyACM*`; the ESP32-P4+C6 display terminal commonly appears as `/dev/ttyACM0` and has its own project.

Serial OTA maintenance commands:

```text
ota_info
ota_update <https_url_to_ESPAgent.bin>
```

The OTA URL must point directly to an HTTPS app `.bin` that fits the 2MB OTA slot.

OTA is currently a maintenance primitive, not an AI code-generation feature. A developer or CI still builds `ESPAgent.bin`; future Agent-side work should only orchestrate version discovery, role matching, Guardian approval, user confirmation, deployment, reboot observation, and result reporting.

## Configuration

Copy the secrets template when build-time credentials are needed:

```bash
cp main/espagent_secrets.h.example main/espagent_secrets.h
```

Credentials can also be set through the serial CLI and stored in NVS. The local setup portal appears as an `ESPAgent-XXXX` Wi-Fi network when onboarding/admin AP mode is active.

Node identity defaults can be set in `main/espagent_secrets.h`:

```c
#define ESPAGENT_SECRET_NODE_ID "esp32s3-edge-01"
#define ESPAGENT_SECRET_NODE_ROLE "edge_agent"
#define ESPAGENT_SECRET_NODE_LOCATION "南京市栖霞区"
#define ESPAGENT_SECRET_MESH_TOPIC_PREFIX "espagent"
#define ESPAGENT_SECRET_NODE_CAPABILITIES "coordinator,communication,sensor,control,guardian,telemetry,timeline,alerts"
#define ESPAGENT_SECRET_NODE_RESPONSIBILITIES "single-node development profile; can chat, sense, control, publish telemetry, and audit mesh state"
```

For a four-ESP32 setup, use the same codebase and assign each board a different node profile:

```text
esp32s3-coordinator-01  coordinator_agent  coordinator,communication,llm,dispatch,timeline,alerts
esp32s3-sensor-01       sensor_agent       sensor,telemetry,environment,air_quality,light,presence
esp32s3-control-01      control_agent      control,gpio,rgb,servo,relay,actuator
esp32s3-guardian-01     guardian_agent     guardian,security,policy,privacy,audit,watchdog,stateboard
```

At the moment, role identity is still mainly a build-time profile. If OTA is used with a firmware image compiled for a different role, the target board's role can change. A later improvement should move role identity into NVS so one OTA image can safely serve all four S3 roles.

## MQTT Mesh Topics

Typical topics under the configured prefix:

```text
espagent/nodes/<node_id>/state
espagent/nodes/<node_id>/telemetry
espagent/nodes/<node_id>/events
espagent/nodes/<node_id>/command
espagent/roles/<role>/command
espagent/agent/dispatch
espagent/agent/timeline
espagent/alerts
espagent/security/policy_check
espagent/security/decision
```

The current lab prefix is `espagent/cube1345`, and the temporary public broker used during bring-up is `broker.emqx.io:1883`. That broker is only for development validation. A production deployment should use a private broker with authentication, TLS, ACLs, and topic isolation.

## Current Boundaries

- The Coordinator still uses one main `agent_loop`; the four S3 boards are not four independent full LLM agents.
- `spawn_subagent` is a bounded local FreeRTOS task, not another physical device. It can use only a small whitelist of non-hardware tools.
- Sensor and Control execute only whitelisted Mesh commands.
- Control checks a cached Guardian allow decision before low/medium-risk actuator execution, but a complete command queue, signed commands, manual confirmation queue, and full safety interlock are still next-stage work.
- Timeline and trace output exist, but full persistent task trees, queryable trace indexes, and watchdog aggregation are not complete yet.
- ESP32-P4/Android Display Terminals should consume the existing MQTT data stream; not every UI card should be described as fully live until verified on hardware.
